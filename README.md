# Surreal Project
MATLAB code that takes in a photo, transforms to grayscale matrix and produces a Gaussian blur of the photo.

There are two files to do this. First, photoInput.m, which converts a jpg photo to a grayscale matrix so we can work with it. Then there is photofftDemo.m which is a script that prompts the user for the name of the photo they'd like to apply a Gaussian blur on.

The main goal of this project was to compare Salvador Dali's Lincoln in Dalivsion with the famous sketching of Abraham Lincoln. We can peel away some of the surrealism from Dali's photo to show his true inspiration for the particular work -- Abraham Lincoln!
